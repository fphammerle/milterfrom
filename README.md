# MilterFrom
This milter compares the envelope sender with the sender specified in the mail header for authenticated users.

It aims to resolve the problem that OpenDKIM signs ALL mails with domains listed in its databases. If you have a multi user setup, user A "a@example.invalid" can send mails with the from field "From: b@example.invalid" and OpenDKIM signs it although user A should not be allowed to send authenticated mails from "b@example.invalid".

The postconf option "reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch" doesn't solve the problem at all, because it only enforces the envelope sender to be correct. This milter further ensures that the sender specified in the header matches the envelope sender.

## Dependencies (as Debian package names)
* git cmake make gcc
* libmilter1.0.1 libmilter-dev

## Build and install
```bash
mkdir build
cd $_
cmake -DWITH_SYSTEMD=ON ..
make
make install # this installs the executable and the Systemd unit
systemctl daemon-reload
```

If you wish to install to a custom directory:
```bash
cmake -DWITH_SYSTEMD=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/your/path ..
```

## Configure (on a Systemd and Postfix environment)
Add a user:
```bash
groupadd milterfrom
useradd -g milterfrom -s /bin/false -d /var/spool/postfix/milterfrom milterfrom
adduser postfix milterfrom
mkdir /var/spool/postfix/milterfrom
chown milterfrom:milterfrom /var/spool/postfix/milterfrom
```

Configure postfix to use the milter:
```
postconf -e "smtpd_milters = unix:/milterfrom/milterfrom$([[ $(postconf -h smtpd_milters) != "" ]] && echo -n ", " && postconf -h smtpd_milters)"
postconf -e "non_smtpd_milters = unix:/milterfrom/milterfrom$([[ $(postconf -h non_smtpd_milters) != "" ]] && echo -n ", " && postconf -h non_smtpd_milters)"
```

Start everything:
```bash
systemctl enable milterfrom
service milterfrom start
service postfix restart
```

## Example
```bash
openssl s_client -connect mail.coolkids.invalid -starttls smtp
```
```
